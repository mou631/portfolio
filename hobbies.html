<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>
  I am very physically active and love to keep myself busy with muscle training
  at the gym and playing competitive 11-a-side football with my team. It
  develops my physical ability along side my decision making skills and fast
  thinking, it also increases ones general life quality so its the core of my
  daily routine. Keeping up with the technology industry is also a keen interest
  of mine, the recent emergence of AI raises countless questions about what the
  future holds and the unknown potential of it all captivates me. My way of
  involving myself with the industry is that I thoroughly enjoy developing my
  own creative skills by developing my own projects that I wish to publish in
  the soon future.
